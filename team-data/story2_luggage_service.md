# Story 2: Luggage Service

## Concept
- When a passenger checks in luggage at the airport, the luggage is delivered directly to their hotel at the destination.
- The only exception is the customs area, where the passenger must handle the luggage personally.

## Workflow
1. Check-in at airport: Luggage is tagged and registered.
2. Luggage is tracked and transported using a secure logistics network.
3. At customs, the passenger retrieves and clears their luggage.
4. After customs, the luggage is handed back to the service and delivered to the hotel.

## Technology
- **Personal Area Network (PAN):**
  - Use PAN (e.g., Bluetooth, NFC) to link luggage with the passenger’s device for real-time status updates and authentication.
- **Pattern Learning:**
  - Apply machine learning to historical transit data to predict and visualize the confidence (sureness) of luggage location and status during transit.

## Visualization
- Dashboard or mobile app shows:
  - Real-time location of luggage
  - Confidence level (sureness) of luggage being on track
  - Alerts for customs pickup and delivery status

## Brainstorming Notes
- [ ] How to handle lost luggage?
- [ ] Integration with hotel check-in systems?
- [ ] Privacy and security concerns with PAN?
- [ ] User experience for customs handoff?
